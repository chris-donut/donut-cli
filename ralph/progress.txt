### 2026-01-15 22:15 - DX-001 (Dexter Phase 1)
- **What was implemented**: CLI Command Module Structure
- **Files changed**: src/cli/index.ts (new), src/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Modular CLI pattern: Create `registerXCommands(program: Command)` functions
  - Shared theme: Move BANNER, DEMO_BANNER, colors to src/cli/theme.ts
  - Import pattern: src/cli/index.ts re-exports all command registration functions
  - Keep original command logic intact when extracting to modules
  - Session commands reduced index.ts from 1350 to 1185 lines (~12% reduction)

### 2026-01-15 22:30 - DX-002/003/004/005 (CLI Modularization Complete)
- **What was implemented**: Full CLI command modularization
- **Files changed**:
  - src/index.ts (reduced from 783 to 67 lines - 91% reduction!)
  - src/cli/index.ts (added exports for all command modules)
  - src/core/dependencies.ts (added AgentDependencies type alias)
  - src/core/providers.ts (added createDefaultDependencies, RiskManagerAdapter)
  - src/agents/base-agent.ts (fixed broken imports)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Command modules already existed but weren't integrated - always check existing files first
  - The composition root pattern (src/cli/index.ts) cleanly separates concerns
  - Pre-existing import bugs can be hidden until code paths are exercised
  - Factory functions (createDefaultDependencies) make DI manageable
  - Type aliases (AgentDependencies = Dependencies) maintain backwards compatibility
  - Main entry point now just: imports + register calls + program.parse()

### 2026-01-15 22:40 - DX-006 (Structured Logging with Pino)
- **What was implemented**: Pino-based structured logging system
- **Files changed**:
  - package.json (added pino, pino-pretty dependencies)
  - src/core/logger.ts (refactored to use Pino backend)
  - src/cli/commands/paper-trading.ts (added structured logging)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Existing logger.ts had good API - just swap the backend to Pino
  - Pino child loggers bind context (component) to all subsequent logs
  - pino-pretty transport for dev, JSON for production (NODE_ENV=production)
  - Keep console.log for user-facing CLI output, use logger for operations
  - LOG_LEVEL, LOG_FORMAT env vars control behavior
